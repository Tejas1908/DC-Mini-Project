**For Modulation:**

 Modulation consists of conversion of the given input digital signal to output BASK 
 signal. This includes the following procedure:

 * A carrier signal is generated.

 * Using random number generator a random number of input digital signal bits is generated(message signal).

 * Then the carrier signal is converted to BASK dignal when the product of message and carrier signal is taken.

 * Finally the BASK signal is plotted. 

 On plotting using matlab the following result was obtained:

 **For Demodulation:**

 Demodulation consists of conversion of the output BASK wave to Discrete digital inputs which we had generated using random number generator.

 * For each signal element in BASK wave the product of carrier signal level and modulating signal level is calculated.

 * Based on the product the demodulated input data bits are plotted.

 On plotting using matlab the following result was obtained:

 **For finding the probability of bit error rate**

The graph of probability of bit error rate is plotted against E<sub>b</sub>/N<sub>o</sub>where, E<sub>b</sub> is signal energy per bit in the baseband signal and is the function of the number of bits that make up the signal energy and symbols in the baseband signal.
N<sub>o</sub> is the noise power density in the baseband signal, and this value is obtained from the noise power and bandwidth of the receiverâ€™s demodulator. A logarithmic graph is plotted for this sake and the equation includes :

This equation gives the probability of bit error rate which is plotted in matlab using <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">erfc</span> function and giving different values to E<sub>b</sub>/N<sub>o</sub> ratio.
