**Abstract:**
 
Digital to analog conversion of signals uses digital modulation techniques because of reasons such as
its capacity to store huge amount of data, high security. Amplitude shift keying is a technique where
the amplitude of the output depends on the input data and it is zero level when the input bit is 0 or
is variation of positive and negative depending on carrier frequency when the input is 1.

**Objectives:**

*	The modulation of the input digital signal to corresponding amplitude shift keying output.

*	Demodulation of the output amplitude shift keying to corresponding digital signal.

*	Probability of the bit error rate with respect to snr (signal to noise ratio).

*	 Comparison of amplitude shift keying with other Shift keying methods.
